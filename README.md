IceHosting was kind of a big host in start of 2025, but it was a summerhost

Hello everyone! I'm itarqos, i was the co-founder of IciesHosting

Since it has shutdown in 2025 February, i have decided to put the backend open-source

[IciesHosting Website](https://icieshosting.shop)

Some functions maybe not working properly because i have shutdown the backend, but the frontend will stay alive til the end of 2025
